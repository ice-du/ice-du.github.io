I am Jinbo Wen (文锦柏), pursuing the M.S. degree with the College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China. My research is supervised by [Prof. Yang Zhang](http://faculty.nuaa.edu.cn/yang/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Prof. Jiawen Kang](https://teacher.gdut.edu.cn/kangjiawen/zh_CN/index.htm). Prior to this, I completed my B.Eng. degree from Guangdong University of Technology, China, in 2023, under the guidance of [Prof. Jiawen Kang](https://teacher.gdut.edu.cn/kangjiawen/zh_CN/index.htm). 

Currently, I also work as a research assistant in the **MetaX Lab**, advised by [Prof. Jiawen Kang](https://teacher.gdut.edu.cn/kangjiawen/zh_CN/index.htm).
